-- Files can not be renamed when paths are relative (works with
   absolute paths);

-- Files can not be renamed

-- Null pointer exception observed once when renaming files (should
   reproduce);

-- JabFox does not get some bibliographies even though Zotero gets
   them;

-- JabRef: PDF can not be retrieved from NDPI "Entropy" even though "Entropy"
   is an OA journal, the PDF is open, and Zotero fetches the PDF.

-- When a wrong encoding is set (UTF-16BE) as a database default, and
   teh database does not have explicit encoding (as when exported from
   Zotero), JabRef just opens it as an empty database, reporting "no
   records found"; JabFox in such case just does noting, even does not
   start JabRef or conncet to existing Jabref.

-- Retro bug: JabRef 2.6 used "UTF8" as the encoding designator, while
   JabRef >= 3.8 uses "UTF-8", making the two databases
   incompatible. Why not saving the database encoding in the same way
   as it was read in?
