-- Files can not be renamed when paths are relative (works with
   absolute paths);

-- Null pointer exception observed once when renaming files (should
   reproduce);

-- Renaming files creates strange empty directories named after the
   PDF file name, e.g. 'Author2006.pdf/' (might be consequence of the
   first two issues);

-- Remaning files throughs 'wrong path component" exception (I'm
   writing an aproximate exception name from memory, needs to be
   double-checked; might be consequence of the first two issues);

-- JabFox does not get some bibliographies even though Zotero gets
   them;

-- JabRef: PDF can not be retrieved from NDPI "Entropy" even though "Entropy"
   is an OA journal, the PDF is open, and Zotero fetches the PDF.

-- When a wrong encoding is set (UTF-16BE) as a database default, and
   teh database does not have explicit encoding (as when exported from
   Zotero), JabRef just opens it as an empty database, reporting "no
   records found"; JabFox in such case just does noting, even does not
   start JabRef or conncet to existing Jabref.

-- second process of JabRef does not start with the exception
   "23:04:45.375 [AWT-EventQueue-0] WARN
   org.jabref.logic.remote.server.RemoteListenerServerLifecycle - Port
   is blocked
   java.net.BindException: Address already in use (Bind failed)"

-- Retro bug: JabRef 2.6 used "UTF8" as the encoding designator, while
   JabRef >= 3.8 uses "UTF-8", making the two databases
   incompatible. Why not saving the database encoding in the same way
   as it was read in?

-- There are two test files:

   saulius@kolibris jabref/ $ ff BibDatabaseContextTest.java
   ./src/test/java/org/jabref/model/BibDatabaseContextTest.java
   ./src/test/java/org/jabref/model/database/BibDatabaseContextTest.java

   Probably they should be merged into
   .../database/BibDatabaseContextTest.java?

-- The .../database/BibDatabaseContextTest.java test uses unix
   specific path strings, e.g. "./relative/subdir". Should we change
   them to Paths.get(".","relative","subdir")?
