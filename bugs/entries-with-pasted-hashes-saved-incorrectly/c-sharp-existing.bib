  abstract = {An article about C#  programs. It contains a strange word- ending with a dash, mentions C# twice, and each time the hash is the last character of the word before the space. The bug manifests itself only when the entry is modified before saving; having the 'timestamp' field triggers such modification silently, without user being aware of it.},
