Thus these programs provide a pedagogically usefulapproach. We develop this topic from scratch, hence without appealto the existence of universal programs, pairing, quotation, or any formof coding device. None of the results are new from the point of viewof computability theory apart from the particular formulations them-selves. We introduce the notion of atext register machine; this is aregister machine whose registers contain words from some alphabetand whose instructions are again words from the same alphabet.
