-- Selecting another group looses highlight of the edited entry.

   When a group interface is used, switching a group interferes with
   the entry list highlight. When I click on the entry in the entry
   list, that entry is highlighted (displayed on a blue background as
   of current design), and the editor tabs are opened below. When I
   switch to a different group that does not contain the edited entry,
   the highlighted entry goes away. When I now refocus on the original
   group again, or on the "All entries" (super)group, the edited entry
   (which is still in the editing tabs!) is not highlighted, not
   brought into the display on the entry list, and is very difficult
   to find (there is not easy-to-find-way to automatically bring the
   edited entry into the list).

-- No way to configure JabRef so that it does *not* create backup
   files.

   There used to be a checkbox in configuration '[x] do not create
   backup files". By default backup file creation was activated, which
   if fine, but I always switch it off in most cases since I use
   version control for any important bibliography databases. Thus the
   backup files from being helpful would become an annoying clutter.

   Unfortunately, in recent JabRef versions (probably with some 4.0 or
   5.0 release) this configuration item was removed, and I now have to
   live with annoying "help" from the program that always leaves a
   *.bak file when the database is saved. This interferes with
   TAB-expansion on the command line, requires additional svn:ignore
   (or .gitignore) settings, and does not bring any useful function
   since all files are versioned anyway which is much more powerful
   than a *.bak file.

   While backup files might be a helpful time saver for some people
   (who do not use version control for their files), in the version
   control setup they are a nuisance and not a help. Would it be
   possible to bring this configuration item back as it used to be
   implemented?

-- Creating a group and dragging an entry there caused an "index out
   of bounds exception".

   The situation is shown in the "Screenshot from 2021-03-13
   21-25-38.png" screen snapshot. Unfortunately, it is impossible to
   reproduce so far...
