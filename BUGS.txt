-- Selecting another group looses highlight of the edited entry.

   When a group interface is used, switching a group interferes with
   the entry list highlight. When I click on the entry in the entry
   list, that entry is highlighted (displayed on a blue background as
   of current design), and the editor tabs are opened below. When I
   switch to a different group that does not contain the edited entry,
   the highlighted entry goes away. When I now refocus on the original
   group again, or on the "All entries" (super)group, the edited entry
   (which is still in the editing tabs!) is not highlighted, not
   brought into the display on the entry list, and is very difficult
   ti find (there is not easy-to-find-way to automatically bring the
   edited entry into the list).
